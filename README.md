# ShipStation Magento Extension
The ShipStation (`Auctane_Api`) module v1.3.51 ported to GitHub.

## Installation
This module is identical to version 1.3.51 of ShipStation as [was originally] found on Magento Connect at http://www.magentocommerce.com/magento-connect/shipstation.html

[Rick Buczynski](https://github.com/vbuck) extended it to provide a `modman` and `composer.json` file for convenient loading as a project dependency, but you can also install it by simply downloading this repo, and dragging-and-dropping the `app` and `skin` directories into your Magento root directory.

## This module is not [currently] available on Magneto Connect
Magento Connect has been decommissioned in favor of the new Magento Marketplace and only [the Magento 2 module](https://marketplace.magento.com/auctane-api.html) is present on Marketplace. As such, I have obtained the newest version from the vendor, and added it to this GitHub repo for ease of access. If you obtain a newer version, feel free to fork and submit a pull request.

## Disclaimer
This module was developed by ShipStation. I am publishing this work publicly on GitHub as an alternative method to installation by Magento Connect. If you wish to make customizations, use your own forks indefinitely.
