# ShipStation Magento Extension
The ShipStation (`Auctane_Api`) module v1.3.27 ported to GitHub from Magento Connect.

## Installation
This module is identical to version 1.3.27 of ShipStation as found on Magento Connect:

http://www.magentocommerce.com/magento-connect/shipstation.html

I have extended it only to provide a `modman` and `composer.json` file for convenient
loading as a project dependency.

## Disclaimer
This module was developed by ShipStation. I am publishing this work publicly on GitHub
as an alternative method to installation by Magento Connect. Please do not submit pull
requests for this module. If you wish to make customizations, use your own forks
indefinitely.
